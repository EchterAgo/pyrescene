 - add, remove, rename stored files from CLI
 - new block for empty directories?
 - new block for oso hashes of archived files (at the end of the SRR)

General

 - Figure out how to get all the unit tests completing successfully when 
   running them all at once with nose in Eclipse instead of running them 
   individually. https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
