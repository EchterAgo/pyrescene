pyReScene
=========

 - Reconstruction of SRRs for compressed RARs
 - SRR support for ZIP files
 - *.sfv as the first parameter
 - add, remove, rename stored files from CLI
 - new block for empty directories?
 - new block for oso hashes of archived files (at the end of the SRR)
 - do not create SRR based on empty SFV files (but do so when .mkv in there)
 - show SRR differences -> use rescene.php
 - an option to just verify an extracted release is valid
 - Auto fails "it works when I send the command specific to that folder, but
   not the whole releasefolder with -r -s"
   Formula1.German.Grand.Prix.2005.PDTV.XviD-LOL\CD1
 - "Defently pysrr still dosnt work correctly when path is too long when 
   I'm missing about 100 samples"
   It created an srr, and stored all the files in, but didnt list any rar files
 - pysrr runs slow sometimes (and not a hard disk issue)

General

 - Figure out how to get all the unit tests completing successfully when 
   running them all at once with nose in Eclipse instead of running them 
   individually. https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
