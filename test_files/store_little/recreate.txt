ReScene .NET 1.2

Usage:  srr <input file list> [switches]
	To create a reconstruction file (SRR), use the release SFV or RAR file.
	All files referenced by the SFV must be in the same folder as the SFV.
		ex: srr example.sfv -s *.nfo -d
	To reconstruct a release, use the SRR file created from the release.
		ex: srr example.srr

Available switches:
	-l: List SRR file contents only.
	-x: Extract SRR stored files only.
	-d: Use parent directory name as basis for generated .srr file name.
	-p: Store file names with paths (relative to the input base directory)
	-r: Attempt to auto-locate renamed files (must have same extension)
	-u: Disable automatic CRC checking during reconstruction.
	-y: Assume Y(es) for all prompts.
	-v: Enable verbose (technical) output.
	-s <file list>: Store additional files in the SRR (wildcards supported)
	-i <path>: Specify input base directory.
	-o <path>: Specify output file or directory path.
	-h <oldname:newname list>: Specify alternate names for extracted files.
		ex: srr example.srr -h orginal.mkv:renamed.mkv
